# Embedly

Enables calls to the Embedly API

TODO:
setup: settings.json and API key
how to run locally, how to run in production

## Setup

Add a file called ```settings.json``` at the root of your project containing:

```
{
  "embedly": "<YOUR_API_KEY>"
}
```

Add this file to your .gitignore, as you don't want your API key in your
codebase
